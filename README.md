# Racers Beta Project v1.0b
LEGO Racers mod with both beta HUD and NPC physics

In the first folder there are all the files related to the beta, for example the beta speedometer and the beta shield texture.
In the second folder there are all custom files. There are some revamped maps (credits to RobExplorien), some directories files for the sfx audio (.SBK).
In the third folder there are 3 textures, one is a small speedometer, one is always a speedometer, but larger and at the end there is a diamond. You can add it to the "***ENH.BMP" texture instead of the white brick, if you want the HUD completely in beta style.

## How to install
1 - Take the folders that you want to install;
2 - Copy them in the original JAM extract;
3 - Rebuild the JAM file;
4 - Put the new JAM into your "Lego Racers" folder;
5 - Run the game
