# LEGO Racers Beta Project v1.0b

The mod with both beta HUD and NPC physics.
In the first folder there are all the files related to the beta, for example the beta speedometer and the beta shield texture.
In the second folder there are all custom files. There are some revamped maps (credits to RobExplorien), some directories files for the sfx audio (.SBK).
In the third folder there are 3 textures, 1 is a small speedometer, 1 is alwais a speedometer, but larger and at the end there is a diamond. You can add it to the "***ENH.BMP" texture instaed of the white brick, if you want the HUD completly in beta style.
